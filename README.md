# Talks about Lambda Calculus

This repository contains things about my presentations at Elixir NYC Meetup, Code BEAM SF and
Code MESH V on Lambda Calculus.

The talks had different lenghts and different audiences, so they differ. Also, Code BEAM and Elixir NYC
were focused on Elixir, while the Code MESH I used JS as main example due to its popularity.
